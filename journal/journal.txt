week 1

journal
This week I used AI while working on the exercises to explain certain Python concepts and to provide coding examples, such as how to use f-strings. I did not use AI to complete any of the exercises, nor did I use it for debugging.

I also tried out Gemini AI this week and did not have a good experience. I ran a comparison test using the same documents and prompts between Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini. Even though I used the same prompts, they gave me very different results.
I used a separate instance of Claude to help design, analyze, and fine-tune the test. In the end, I optimized the prompt and documents for ChatGPT and was able to dial in results that were close to my expected targets. Through this process, I learned a lot about why different AI models return such different results on the same prompts.
It turns out it’s often due to biases in their analytic models—not unlike people.

Week 2

I did use AI while working on my exercises to help me better understand the concepts we were using,
specifically with the loops, when asking ChatGPT to explain loops and what they are in python. https://chatgpt.com/c/68d1718e-f008-832c-80e3-9f09e1d467c4
I did not use it for debugging this week, I did look at the examples given to me in Gemini as well to get a better idea of how to use loops as well. They really helped me get a better idea of how to incorporate loops into my code.

Week 3

I did use AI while working on my exercises this week becuase I was stuck on acouple problems again with loops and 
If statements, https://chatgpt.com/c/68d1718e-f008-832c-80e3-9f09e1d467c4. I think I learned this week that the use of 
AI is not a horrible thing many of these professors say. I think it can be a very powerful tool that all people can use to make them more proficient
 at what they do.

Week 4

I did use AI while working on my exercises this week, I used it more than I would like to but it was able to 
help me understand the exercises better. I used it to show me how complete these type of exercises by not only 
showing me the code but explaining why. https://chatgpt.com/c/68e313de-9184-8320-bda2-f41c494067e8
Im learning more each week that AI is a tool that can be used correctly or abused, when you abuse it, it may cause
more harm than good.

Week 5

I did use AI while working on my week 5 exercises, I used it to debug a few times and asked it what certain parts
of code meant, for example, I stil wanted more information about the @property command, Chat GPT gave me a very
easy to understand anwser and an example of how it is used which gave me clarity on the exercises this week.

week 6 

I did use some AI on my week 6 exercises, I used it do debug my code twice and to help me with understanding how to 
start writing your code. I think the hardest thing for me when im coding is to start writing becuase its hard to get 
more ideas about what to write when you have a blank canvas so that helped me better figure  out how to get things 
going. https://chatgpt.com/c/68fed020-d6c4-832f-872a-62753672309e

Week 7

I did use AI while working on my week 7 exercises, I used it for debugging and specifically for try/except commands
becuase I was still having trouble understanding them. I learned that when python tries to run everything in the (try:) block,
and there is an error, it will jump to the except block and run from there. https://chatgpt.com/c/69090227-60d4-8329-ad05-ae8092a00a00

Week 8 
During my Week 8 exercises, I continued using AI as a debugging partner, especially when I hit a string of errors that slowed me down. 
A lot of my issues this week came from small mistakes that had big ripple effects: indentation errors that broke my control flow, missing colons, and exceptions I didn’t anticipate.
I leaned on AI to help me trace where things were going wrong and to confirm whether the logic in my functions matched what Python actually expected.

Week 9 
During my Week 9 exercises, I kept using AI as a support tool, but this time I focused more on refining my logic rather than fixing basic syntax issues.
I still ran into some problems—mainly with functions not behaving the way I expected and a few errors that were caused by how I structured my conditions. But instead of getting stuck on the surface-level mistakes, I spent more time understanding why the errors were happening.
AI helped me double-check my approach, especially when I wasn’t sure whether I was using the right method or applying the correct logic to a problem.
