week 1

journal
This week I used AI while working on the exercises to explain certain Python concepts and to provide coding examples, such as how to use f-strings. I did not use AI to complete any of the exercises, nor did I use it for debugging.

I also tried out Gemini AI this week and did not have a good experience. I ran a comparison test using the same documents and prompts between Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini. Even though I used the same prompts, they gave me very different results.
I used a separate instance of Claude to help design, analyze, and fine-tune the test. In the end, I optimized the prompt and documents for ChatGPT and was able to dial in results that were close to my expected targets. Through this process, I learned a lot about why different AI models return such different results on the same prompts.
It turns out it’s often due to biases in their analytic models—not unlike people.

Week 2

I did use AI while working on my exercises to help me better understand the concepts we were using,
specifically with the loops, when asking ChatGPT to explain loops and what they are in python. https://chatgpt.com/c/68d1718e-f008-832c-80e3-9f09e1d467c4
I did not use it for debugging this week, I did look at the examples given to me in Gemini as well to get a better idea of how to use loops as well. They really helped me get a better idea of how to incorporate loops into my code.

Week 3

I did use AI while working on my exercises this week becuase I was stuck on acouple problems again with loops and 
If statements, https://chatgpt.com/c/68d1718e-f008-832c-80e3-9f09e1d467c4. I think I learned this week that the use of 
AI is not a horrible thing many of these professors say. I think it can be a very powerful tool that all people can use to make them more proficient
 at what they do.
